This project retrieves data from the Yelp API for restaurants by location
and by category. It turns that data from a series of json files into
csv files at a variety of levels of aggregation---search-level,
restaurant-level, city or zip-code level---to facilitate mapping,
visualization, and analysis.

You'll need an API key saved in src/yelp.yml to use this code.

UPDATE, 2018-02-22: this code has be updated to use v3 of the Yelp API.
